## concept:
- Python stipulates that all objects should produce two different string representations: one that is human-interpretable text and one that is a Python-interpretable expression. The constructor function for strings, str, returns a human-readable string. Where possible, the repr function returns a Python expression that evaluates to an equal object.
- In Python, certain special names are invoked by the Python interpreter in special circumstances. For instance, the __init__ method of a class is automatically invoked whenever an object is constructed. The __str__ method is invoked automatically when printing, and __repr__ is invoked in an interactive session to display values.
- Callable objects. In Python, functions are first-class objects, so they can be passed around as data and have attributes like any other object. Python also allows us to define objects that can be "called" like functions by including a __call__ method. With this method, we can define a class that behaves like a higher-order function.
- Interfaces. Object attributes, which are a form of message passing, allows different data types to respond to the same message in different ways
- An attribute of an object is a name-value pair associated with the object, which is accessible via dot notation.
- The method that initializes objects has a special name in Python, __init__ (two underscores on each side of the word "init"), and is called the constructor for the class.
- To enforce this separation, every object that is an instance of a user-defined class has a unique identity. Object identity is compared using the is and is not operators.
- . A dot expression evaluates to the value of the attribute with the given <name>, for the object that is the value of the <expression>.
- These two results differ only in the fact that the first is a standard two-argument function with parameters self and amount. The second is a one-argument method, where the name self will be bound to the object named spock_account automatically when the method is called, while the parameter amount will be bound to the argument passed to the method. Both of these values, whether function values or bound method values, are associated with the same deposit function body.
-  Python's convention dictates that if an attribute name starts with an underscore, it should only be accessed within methods of the class itself, rather than by users of the class.
- However, a single assignment statement to a class attribute changes the value of the attribute for all instances of the class.
- To look up a name in a class.

If it names an attribute in the class, return the attribute value.
Otherwise, look up the name in the base class, if there is one.
