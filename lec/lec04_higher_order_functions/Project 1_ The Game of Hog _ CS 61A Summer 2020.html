<p>Although the checkpoint date is only a few days from the final due date, you
should not put off completing Phase 1. We recommend starting and finishing
Phase 1 as soon as possible to give yourself adequate time to complete Phases
2 and 3, which are can be more time consuming.</p>

<p>You do not have to wait until after the checkpoint date to start Phases 2 and 3.</p>

<p>Phase 1 is individual, Phases 2 and 3 can be completed with a partner.</p>

<p>You can get 1 extra credit point by submitting the entire project one day early on <strong>Tuesday, July 7</strong>.</p></blockquote>

<p>In this project, you will develop a simulator and multiple strategies
for the dice game Hog. You will need to use <em>control statements</em> and
<em>higher-order functions</em> together, as described in Sections 1.2 through
1.6 of <a href="http://composingprograms.com/">Composing Programs</a>.</p>


<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>


<p>In Hog, two players alternate turns trying to be the first to end a turn with
at least 100 total points. On each turn, the current player chooses some number
of dice to roll, up to 10. That player's score for the turn is the sum of the
dice outcomes. However, a player who rolls too many dice risks:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pig Out</strong>. If any of the dice outcomes is a 1, the current player's score
  for the turn is 1.</li>
</ul>


        <button id="toggle-1" class="btn btn-outline btn-lg alwaystoggle toggle" style="display: inline-block;">
        Examples<noscript> (enable JavaScript)</noscript>
        </button>
        <div class="solution toggle-1">

<ul>
  <li><em>Example 1</em>: The current player rolls 7 dice, 5 of which are 1's. They
  score 1 point for the turn.</li>
  <li><em>Example 2</em>: The current player rolls 4 dice, all of which are 3's. Since
  Pig Out did not occur, they score 12 points for the turn.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<p>In a normal game of Hog, those are all the rules. To spice up the game, we'll
include some special rules:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Free Bacon</strong>. A player who chooses to roll zero dice scores points equal to ten minus the value of the opponent score's ones digit, summed with the value of the opponent's score's tens digit.</li>
</ul>


        <button id="toggle-2" class="btn btn-outline btn-lg alwaystoggle toggle" style="display: inline-block;">
        Examples<noscript> (enable JavaScript)</noscript>
        </button>
        <div class="solution toggle-2">

<ul>
  <li><em>Example 1</em>: The opponent has a score of 32, and the current player rolls zero dice. The current player will receive <code>10 - 2 + 3 = 11</code> points.</li>
  <li><em>Example 2</em>: The opponent has a score of 19, and the current player rolls zero dice. The current player will receive <code>10 - 9 + 1 = 2</code> points.</li>
  <li><em>Example 3</em>: The opponent has a score of 80, and the current player rolls zero dice. The current player will receive <code>10 - 0 + 8 = 18</code> points.</li>
  <li><em>Example 4</em>: The opponent has a score of 5, and the current player rolls zero dice. The current player will receive <code>10 - 5 + 0 = 5</code> points.</li>
</ul>

</div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Feral Hogs</strong>. If the number of dice you roll is exactly 2 away (absolute difference) from the number of points you scored on the previous turn, you get 3 extra points for the turn. Treat the turn before the first turn as scoring 0 points. Do <strong>not</strong> take into account any previous feral hog bonuses or swine swap (next rule) when calculating the number of points scored the previous turn.</li>
</ul>


        <button id="toggle-3" class="btn btn-outline btn-lg alwaystoggle toggle" style="display: inline-block;">
        Examples<noscript> (enable JavaScript)</noscript>
        </button>
        <div class="solution toggle-3">

<ul>
  <li><p><em>Example 1:</em></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Both players start out at 0. (0, 0)</li>
    <li>Player 0 rolls 3 dice and gets <strong><font color="red">7</font></strong> points. (7, 0)</li>
    <li>Player 1 rolls 1 dice and gets <strong><font color="red">4</font></strong> points. (7, 4)</li>
    <li>Player 0 rolls <strong><font color="blue">5</font></strong> dice and gets <strong><font color="#0d0">10</font></strong> points. <strong><font color="blue">5</font></strong> is 2 away from <strong><font color="red">7</font></strong>, so player 0 gets a bonus of 3. (20, 4)</li>
    <li>Player 1 rolls <strong><font color="blue">2</font></strong> dice and gets <strong><font color="#0d0">8</font></strong> points. <strong><font color="blue">2</font></strong> is 2 away from <strong><font color="red">4</font></strong>, so player 1 gets a bonus of 3. (20, 15)</li>
    <li>Player 0 rolls <strong><font color="#888">8</font></strong> dice and gets 20 points. <strong><font color="#888">8</font></strong> is 2 away from <strong><font color="#0d0">10</font></strong>, so player 0 gets a bonus of 3. (43, 15)</li>
    <li>Player 1 rolls <strong><font color="#888">6</font></strong> dice and gets 1 point. <strong><font color="#888">6</font></strong> is 2 away from <strong><font color="#0d0">8</font></strong>, so player 1 gets a bonus of 3. (43, 19)</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p><em>Example 2:</em></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Both players start out at 0. (0, 0)</li>
    <li>Player 0 rolls 2 dice and gets 3 points. 2 is 2 away from 0, so player 0 gets a bonus of 3. (6, 0)</li>
  </ul></li>
</ul>

</div>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Swine Swap</strong>. After points for the turn are added to the current player's score, if the absolute value of the difference between the current player score's ones digit and the opponent score's ones digit is equal to the value of the opponent score's tens digit, the scores should be swapped. <strong>A swap may occur at the end of a turn in which a player reaches the goal score, leading to the opponent winning.</strong></li>
</ul>

        <div class="solution toggle-4">

<ul>
  <li><em>Example 1</em>: At the end of the first player's turn, the players have scores of 6 and 2. The difference in the ones digits is <code>6 - 2 = 4</code>, and 4 != 0 (which is the tens digit of the second player), so no swap occurs.</li>
  <li><em>Example 2</em>: At the end of the first player's turn, the players have scores of 17 and 65. The difference in the ones digits is <code>7 - 5 = 2</code>, and 2 != 6 (which is the tens digit of the second player), so no swap occurs.</li>
  <li><em>Example 3</em>: At the end of the first player's turn, the players have scores of 55 and 23. The difference in the ones digits is <code>5 - 3 = 2</code>, and 2 == 2 (which is the tens digit of the second player), so the scores are swapped.</li>
  <li><em>Example 4</em>: At the end of the first player's turn, the players have scores of 89 and 54. The difference in the ones digits is <code>9 - 4 = 5</code>, and 5 == 5 (which is the tens digit of the second player), so the scores are swapped.</li>

<p>Our staff solution to the project can be interacted with at <a href="https://hog.cs61a.org/">hog.cs61a.org</a> -- if you'd like, try it out now! When you finish the project, you'll have implemented a significant part of this game yourself!</p>


<h2 id="download-starter-files">Download starter files</h2>


<p>To get started, download all of the project code as a <a href="https://cs61a.org/proj/hog/hog.zip">zip archive</a>.
Below is a list of all the files you will see in the archive. However, you only
have to make changes to <code>hog.py</code>.</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>hog.py</code>: A starter implementation of Hog</li>
  <li><code>dice.py</code>: Functions for rolling dice</li>
  <li><code>hog_gui.py</code>: A graphical user interface for Hog</li>
  <li><code>ucb.py</code>: Utility functions for CS 61A</li>
  <li><code>ok</code>: CS 61A autograder</li>
  <li><code>tests</code>: A directory of tests used by <code>ok</code></li>
  <li><code>gui_files</code>: A directory of various things used by the web gui.</li>
</ul>




<h2 id="logistics">Logistics</h2>



<!-- <p>Remember that you can earn an additional bonus point by submitting the
  project at least 24 hours before the deadline.</p> -->



<p>The project is worth 25 points. 22 points are assigned for correctness, 1 point for
submitting Part I by the checkpoint date, and 2 points for the overall
<a href="https://cs61a.org//articles/composition.html">composition</a>.</p>


<p>You will turn in the following files:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>hog.py</code></li>
</ul>

<p>You do not need to modify or turn in any other files to complete the
project. To submit the project, run the following command:</p>

<pre><code class="hljs sql">python3 ok <span class="hljs-comment">--submit</span></code></pre>

<p>You will be able to view your submissions on the <a href="http://ok.cs61a.org/">Ok dashboard</a>.</p>

<p>For the functions that we ask you to complete, there may be some
initial code that we provide. If you would rather not use that code,
feel free to delete it and start from scratch. You may also add new
function definitions as you see fit.</p>

<p>However, please do <b>not</b> modify any other functions.  Doing so may
result in your code failing our autograder tests. Also, please do not
change any function signatures (names, argument order, or number of
arguments).</p>



<p>Throughout this project, you should be testing the correctness of your code.
It is good practice to test often, so that it is easy to isolate any problems.
However, you should not be testing <i>too</i> often, to allow yourself time to
think through problems.</p>

<p>We have provided an <b>autograder</b> called <code>ok</code> to help you
with testing your code and tracking your progress. The first time you run the
autograder, you will be asked to <b>log in with your Ok account using your web
browser</b>. Please do so. Each time you run <code>ok</code>, it will back up
your work and progress on our servers.</p>

<p>The primary purpose of <code>ok</code> is to test your implementations.</p>

<!-- <p>First, some of the test cases are <i>locked</i>. To unlock tests, run the
following command from your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok -u</code></pre>

<p>This command will start an interactive prompt that looks like:</p>

<pre>

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Question 0 &gt; Suite 1 &gt; Case 1
(cases remaining: 1)

&gt;&gt;&gt; Code here
?
</pre>

<p>At the <code>?</code>, you can type what you expect the output to be. If you
are correct, then this test case will be available the next time you run the
autograder.</p>

<p>The idea is to understand <i>conceptually</i> what your program should do
first, before you start writing any code.</p>

<p>Once you have unlocked some tests and written some code, you can check the
correctness of your program using the tests that you have unlocked:</p>

<pre>python3 ok</pre>

<p>Most of the time, you will want to focus on a particular question. Use the
<code>-q</code> option as directed in the problems below.</p>  -->

<!-- <p>Second, there may be some test cases that are <i>hidden</i>. These test cases are
<b>not</b> run by the command:</p> -->

<!--<pre>python3 ok</pre>-->

<!-- <p>They are only run when you submit:</p> -->

<!-- <pre>python3 ok --submit</pre> -->

<!-- <p> We keep test cases hidden to ensure that you write your code with the intention
of solving the question at hand, not purely to pass the given tests. The hidden
tests will be run when you submit your project. You will receive an email with part of
the autograder results after submitting. However, the autograder has a 15 minute
cooldown period. If you submit before 15 minutes have passed, the autograder will
not run.</p> -->

<p>We recommend that you submit <b>after you finish each
problem</b>. Only your last submission will be graded. It is also useful for us
to have more backups of your code in case you run into a submission issue.</p>

<!--<p>After you run this command, you will receive an email (to the address-->
<!--that you used to sign up for Ok) that has the output from all <i>failed</i>-->
<!--unlocked tests, including hidden tests, along with your score at the bottom. You-->
<!--can continue submitting until you pass all the tests. However, you will receive-->
<!--<b>at most one email every half hour</b>.</p>-->

<!--<p>This buffer period is meant for you and your partner to try and understand-->
<!--where your error comes from, and take some time to think through your code. We-->
<!--encourage you to do this for all projects.</p>-->

<!---
<p>If you are trying to debug a test failure, you can launch an interactive session
after the test is run with:</p>

<pre><code>python3 ok &#x2d;q 05 &#x2d;i</code></pre>

<p>This will run the tests and launch an interactive session if a test does not
pass.</p>

<!--- <p>The <code>tests</code> folder is used to store autograder tests, so
<b>do not modify it</b>. You may lose all your unlocking progress if you
do. If you need to get a fresh copy, you can download the
<a href="hog.zip">zip archive</a> and copy it over, but you
will need to start unlocking from scratch.</p> -->

<p>If you do not want us to record a backup of your work or information about
your progress, you can run

</p><pre>python3 ok --local</pre>


With this option, no information will be sent to our course
servers.

If you want to test your code interactively, you can run

<pre> python3 ok -q [question number] -i </pre>

with the appropriate question number (e.g. <code>01</code>) inserted.
This will run the tests for that question until the first one you failed,
then give you a chance to test the functions you wrote interactively.<p></p>

<p>You can also use the debug printing feature in OK by writing

</p><pre> print("DEBUG:", x) </pre>

which will produce an output in your terminal without causing OK tests to fail
with extra output.

<h2 id="graphical-user-interface">Graphical User Interface</h2>


<p>A <strong>graphical user interface</strong> (GUI, for short) is provided for you.
At the moment, it doesn't work because you haven't implemented the
game logic.  Once you complete the <code>play</code> function, you will be able
to play a fully interactive version of Hog!</p>

<p>Once you've done that, you can run the GUI from your terminal:</p>

<pre><code class="hljs">python3 hog_gui.py</code></pre>


<h2 id="phase-1-simulator">Phase 1: Simulator</h2>


<blockquote><p><strong>Important submission note:</strong> For full credit:</p>

<ul>
  <li>submit with Phase 1 complete by <strong>Friday, July 3</strong> (worth 1 pt).</li>
</ul>

<p>All Phase 1 tests must pass
  in order to receive this point.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the first phase, you will develop a simulator for the game of Hog.</p>


<h3 id="problem-0-0-pt">Problem 0 (0 pt)</h3>


<p>The <code>dice.py</code> file represents dice using non-pure zero-argument functions. These
functions are non-pure because they may have different return values each time
they are called. The documentation of <code>dice.py</code> describes the two different
types of dice used in the project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dice can be fair, meaning that they produce each possible outcome with equal
  probability. Example: <code>six_sided</code>.</li>
  <li>For testing functions that use dice, deterministic test dice always cycle
  through a fixed sequence of values that are passed as arguments to the
  <code>make_test_dice</code> function.</li>
</ul>

<p>Before writing any code, read over the <code>dice.py</code> file and check your
understanding by unlocking the following tests.</p>

<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 00 -u</code></pre>

<p>This should display a prompt that looks like this:</p>

<p>Implement the <code>roll_dice</code> function in <code>hog.py</code>. It takes two arguments: a
positive integer called <code>num_rolls</code> giving the number of dice to roll and a
<code>dice</code> function. It returns the number of points scored by rolling the dice that
number of times in a turn: either the sum of the outcomes or 1 (<em>Pig Out</em>).</p>

<blockquote><p>The Pig Out rule is reproduced below:</p></blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Pig Out</strong>. If any of the dice outcomes is a 1, the current player's score
  for the turn is 1.</p>

        <div class="solution toggle-5">

  <ul>
    <li><em>Example 1</em>: The current player rolls 7 dice, 5 of which are 1's. They
    score 1 point for the turn.</li>
    <li><em>Example 2</em>: The current player rolls 4 dice, all of which are 3's. Since
    Pig Out did not occur, they score 12 points for the turn.</li>
  </ul>

  </div></li>
</ul>

<p>To obtain a single outcome of a dice roll, call <code>dice()</code>. You should call
<code>dice()</code> exactly <code>num_rolls</code> times in the body of <code>roll_dice</code>. <strong>Remember to call
<code>dice()</code> exactly <code>num_rolls</code> times even if Pig Out happens in the middle of
rolling.</strong> In this way, you correctly simulate rolling all the dice together.</p>

<blockquote><p>You can't implement the feral hogs rule in this problem, since <code>roll_dice</code>
doesn't have the previous number of rolls as an argument. It will be implemented
later.</p></blockquote>

        </button>
        <div class="solution toggle-6">

<p>If the tests don't pass, it's time to debug. You can observe the behavior of
your function using Python directly. First, start the Python interpreter and
load the <code>hog.py</code> file.</p>

<pre><code class="hljs">python3 -i hog.py</code></pre>

<p>Then, you can call your <code>roll_dice</code> function on any number of dice you want.
The <code>roll_dice</code> function has a <a href="http://composingprograms.com/pages/14-designing-functions.html#default-argument-values">default argument value</a> for <code>dice</code> that is
a random six-sided dice function. Therefore, the following call to <code>roll_dice</code>
simulates rolling four fair six-sided dice.</p>

<pre><code class="hljs python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>roll_dice(<span class="hljs-number">4</span>)</code></pre>

<p>You will find that the previous expression may have a different result each time
you call it, since it is simulating random dice rolls. You can also use test dice
that fix the outcomes of the dice in advance. For example, rolling twice when you
know that the dice will come up 3 and 4 should give a total outcome of 7.</p>

<pre><code class="hljs python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>fixed_dice = make_test_dice(<span class="hljs-number">3</span>, <span class="hljs-number">4</span>)

<span class="hljs-number">7</span></code></pre>

<blockquote><p>On most systems, you can evaluate the same expression again by pressing the
up arrow, then pressing enter or return. If you want to get the second last,
third last, etc., command you made, press up arrow repeatedly.</p>

<p>If you find a problem, you need to change your <code>hog.py</code> file, save it, quit
Python, start it again, and then start evaluating expressions. Pressing the
up arrow should give you access to your previous expressions, even after
restarting Python.</p></blockquote>

<p>Continue debugging your code and running the <code>ok</code> tests until they all pass. You
should follow this same procedure of understanding the problem, implementing a
solution, testing, and debugging for all the problems on this project.</p>

<code>python3 ok -q 01 -i</code> instead. This will open an interpreter and then run
the test until the first test example that fails.</p></blockquote>

<p>Implement the <code>play</code> function, which simulates a full game of Hog. Players
alternate turns rolling dice until one of the players reaches the <code>goal</code> score.</p>

<p>You can ignore the <strong>Feral Hogs</strong> rule and <code>feral_hogs</code> argument for now;
You'll implement it in Problem 5b.</p>

<p>To determine how much dice are rolled each turn, each player uses their
respective strategy (Player 0 uses <code>strategy0</code> and Player 1 uses <code>strategy1</code>).
A <em>strategy</em> is a function that, given a player's score and their opponent's
score, returns the number of dice that the current player wants to roll in the
turn. Each strategy function should be called only once per turn. Don't worry
about the details of implementing strategies yet. You will develop them in
Phase 3.</p>

<p>When the game ends, <code>play</code> returns the final total scores of both players, with
Player 0's score first, and Player 1's score second.</p>

<p>Here are some hints:</p>

<ul>
  <li>You should use the functions you have already written! You will need to call
  <code>take_turn</code> with all three arguments.</li>
  <li>Only call <code>take_turn</code> once per turn.</li>
  <li>Enforce all the special rules except for feral hogs.</li>

(That way, test cases for 5a will still pass after you solve 5b.)</p>

<blockquote><p>The Feral Hogs rule is reproduced below:</p></blockquote>

<ul>
  <li><p><strong>Feral Hogs</strong>. If the number of dice you roll is exactly 2 away (absolute difference) from the number of points you scored on the previous turn, you get 3 extra points for the turn. Treat the turn before the first turn as scoring 0 points. Do <strong>not</strong> take into account any previous feral hog bonuses or swine swap (next rule) when calculating the number of points scored the previous turn.</p>

<blockquote><p>You can work on and submit Phase 2 and 3 with a partner! Make sure one of you
submits and then adds the other as a partner on okpy.org.</p></blockquote>

<p>In the second phase, you will implement commentary functions that print remarks
about the game after each turn, such as, <code>"22 points! That's the biggest gain yet
for Player 1."</code></p>

<p>A commentary function takes two arguments, Player 0's current score and Player
1's current score. It can print out commentary based on either or both current
scores and any other information in its parent environment. Since commentary can
differ from turn to turn depending on the current point situation in the game, a
commentary function always returns another commentary function to be called on
the next turn. The only side effect of a commentary function should be to print.</p>


<h3 id="commentary-examples">Commentary examples</h3>


<p>The function <code>say_scores</code> in <code>hog.py</code> is an example of a commentary function
that simply announces both players' scores. Note that <code>say_scores</code> returns

<p>Update your <code>play</code> function so that a commentary function is called at the end

commentary function to call on the next turn.</p>

<p>For example, <code>say(score0, score1)</code> should be called at the end of the first

<h3 id="problem-7-3-pt">Problem 7 (3 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>announce_highest</code> function, which is a higher-order function that
returns a commentary function. This commentary function announces whenever a
particular player gains more points in a turn than ever before. E.g.,
<code>announce_highest(1)</code> and its return value ignore Player 0 entirely and just
print information about Player 1. To compute the gain, it must compare the score
from last turn to the score from this turn for the player of interest, which is
designated by the <code>who</code> argument. This function must also keep track of the
highest gain for the player so far.</p>

<p>The way in which <code>announce_highest</code> announces is very specific, and your
implementation should match the doctests provided. Don't worry about singular
versus plural when announcing point gains; you should simply use "point(s)" for
both cases.</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>Hint.</strong> The <code>announce_lead_changes</code> function provided to you is an example of
how to keep track of information using commentary functions. If you are stuck,
first make sure you understand how <code>announce_lead_changes</code> works.</p></blockquote>

<br>

<blockquote><p><strong>Note:</strong> The doctests for <code>both</code>/<code>announce_highest</code> in hog.py might describe
a game that can't occur according to the rules. This shouldn't be an issue for
commentary functions since they don't implement any of the rules of the game.</p></blockquote>

<br>

<blockquote><p><strong>Hint.</strong> If you're getting a <code>local variable [var] reference before assignment</code> error:</p>

<p>This happens because in Python, you aren't normally allowed to modify
variables defined in parent frames. Instead of reassigning <code>[var]</code>, the
interpreter thinks you're trying to define a new variable within the current
frame. We'll learn about how to work around this in a future lecture, but it
is not required for this problem.</p>

<p>To fix this, you have two options:</p>

<p>1) Rather than reassigning <code>[var]</code> to its new value, create a new variable to
   hold that new value. Use that new variable in future calculations.</p>

<p>2) For this problem specifically, avoid this issue entirely by not using
   assignment statements at all. Instead, pass new values in as arguments to
   a call to <code>announce_highest</code>.</p></blockquote>

it returns the average value of repeatedly calling <code>original_function</code> on the same arguments.
This function should call <code>original_function</code> a total of <code>trials_count</code> times and return the
average of the results.</p>

<p>To implement this function, you need a new piece of Python syntax! You
must write a function that accepts an arbitrary number of arguments,
then calls another function using exactly those arguments. Here's how
it works.</p>

<p>Instead of listing formal parameters for a function, you can write <code>*args</code>. To
call another function using exactly those arguments, you call it again with
<code>*args</code>. For example,</p>

<pre><code class="hljs python"><span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span><span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title">printed</span><span class="hljs-params">(f)</span>:</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">... </span>    <span class="hljs-function"><span class="hljs-keyword">def</span> <span class="hljs-title">print_and_return</span><span class="hljs-params">(*args)</span>:</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">... </span>        result = f(*args)
<span class="hljs-meta">... </span>        print(<span class="hljs-string">'Result:'</span>, result)
<span class="hljs-meta">... </span>        <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> result
<span class="hljs-meta">... </span>    <span class="hljs-keyword">return</span> print_and_return
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>printed_pow = printed(pow)
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>printed_pow(<span class="hljs-number">2</span>, <span class="hljs-number">8</span>)
Result: <span class="hljs-number">256</span>
<span class="hljs-number">256</span>
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>printed_abs = printed(abs)
<span class="hljs-meta">&gt;&gt;&gt; </span>printed_abs(<span class="hljs-number">-10</span>)
Result: <span class="hljs-number">10</span>
<span class="hljs-number">10</span></code></pre>

<p>Read the docstring for <code>make_averaged</code> carefully to understand how it
is meant to work.</p>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 08 -u</code></pre>
<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 08</code></pre>


<h3 id="problem-9-2-pt">Problem 9 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement the <code>max_scoring_num_rolls</code> function, which runs an experiment to
determine the number of rolls (from 1 to 10) that gives the maximum average
score for a turn.  Your implementation should use <code>make_averaged</code> and
<code>roll_dice</code>.</p>

<p>If two numbers of rolls are tied for the maximum average score, return the
lower number. For example, if both 3 and 6 achieve a maximum average score,
return 3.</p>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 09 -u</code></pre>
<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 09</code></pre>

<p>To run this experiment on randomized dice, call <code>run_experiments</code> using
the <code>-r</code> option:</p>

<pre><code class="hljs">python3 hog.py -r</code></pre>

<p><strong>Running experiments</strong> For the remainder of this project, you can change the
implementation of <code>run_experiments</code> as you wish.  By calling
<code>average_win_rate</code>, you can evaluate various Hog strategies. For example,
change the first <code>if False:</code> to <code>if True:</code> in order to evaluate
<code>always_roll(8)</code> against the baseline strategy of <code>always_roll(6)</code>.</p>

<p>Some of the experiments may take up to a minute to run. You can always reduce
the number of trials in your call to <code>make_averaged</code> to speed up experiments.</p>


<h3 id="problem-10-1-pt">Problem 10 (1 pt)</h3>


<p>A strategy can try to take advantage of the <em>Free Bacon</em> rule by rolling 0 when
it is most beneficial to do so. Implement <code>bacon_strategy</code>, which returns 0
whenever rolling 0 would give <strong>at least</strong> <code>cutoff</code> points and returns
<code>num_rolls</code> otherwise.</p>

<blockquote><p>Note it is impossible for strategies to know what number of points the current
player earned on the previous turn, and thus we cannot predict feral hogs.
For strategies, we do not take into account bonuses from feral hogs to calculate
bonuses against the cutoff or whether a swap will occur</p></blockquote>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 10 -u</code></pre>
<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 10</code></pre>

<p>Once you have implemented this strategy, change <code>run_experiments</code> to evaluate
your new strategy against the baseline. Is it better than just rolling 4?</p>


<h3 id="problem-11-2-pt">Problem 11 (2 pt)</h3>


<p>A strategy can also take advantage of the <em>Swine Swap</em> rule. The swap strategy always
rolls 0 if doing so triggers a beneficial swap and always avoids rolling 0 if doing
so triggers a detrimental swap. In other cases, it rolls 0 if rolling 0 would give
<strong>at least</strong> <code>cutoff</code> points. Otherwise, the strategy rolls <code>num_rolls</code>.</p>

<blockquote><p>Note it is impossible for strategies to know what number of points the current
player earned on the previous turn, and thus we cannot predict feral hogs.
For strategies, we do not take into account bonuses from feral hogs to calculate
bonuses against the cutoff or whether a swap will occur</p>

<p>Hint: a tie is technically a "swap" (e.g., 43 being swapped with 43), but is
considered neither detrimental nor beneficial for the purposes of this problem.</p></blockquote>

<p>Before writing any code, unlock the tests to verify your understanding of the question.</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 11 -u</code></pre>
<p>Once you are done unlocking, begin implementing your solution. You can check your correctness with:</p>
<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 11</code></pre>

<p>Once you have implemented this strategy, update <code>run_experiments</code> to evaluate
your new strategy against the baseline.  You should find that it gives a
significant edge over <code>always_roll(4)</code>.</p>


<h3 id="optional-problem-12-0-pt">Optional: Problem 12 (0 pt)</h3>


<p>Implement <code>final_strategy</code>, which combines these ideas and any other ideas you
have to achieve a high win rate against the <code>always_roll(4)</code> strategy. Some
suggestions:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>swap_strategy</code> is a good default strategy to start with.</li>
  <li>There's no point in scoring more than 100. Check whether you can win by
  rolling 0, 1 or 2 dice. If you are in the lead, you might take fewer risks.</li>
  <li>Try to force a beneficial swap rolling more than 0 dice.</li>
  <li>Choose the <code>num_rolls</code> and <code>cutoff</code> arguments carefully.</li>
  <li>Take the action that is most likely to win the game.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can check that your final strategy is valid by running Ok.</p>

<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok -q 12</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>Note: <code>calc.py</code> does not currently work. We're fixing a bug with the server and
will make it work soon.</p></blockquote>

<p>You will also eventually be able to check your exact final win rate by running</p>

<pre><code class="hljs">python3 calc.py</code></pre>

<p>This should pop up a window asking for you to confirm your identity, and then
it will print out a win rate for your final strategy.</p>

<p>At this point, run the entire autograder to see if there are any tests
that don't pass.</p>

<pre><code class="hljs">python3 ok</code></pre>

<p>Once you are satisfied, submit to Ok to complete the project.</p>

<pre><code class="hljs sql">python3 ok <span class="hljs-comment">--submit</span></code></pre>

<p>If you have a partner, make sure to add them to the submission on okpy.org.</p>

<p>Check to make sure that you did all the problems by running</p>

<pre><code class="hljs sql">python3 ok <span class="hljs-comment">--score</span></code></pre>

<p>You can also play against your final strategy with the graphical user
interface:</p>

<pre><code class="hljs">python3 hog_gui.py</code></pre>

<p>The GUI will alternate which player is controlled by you.</p>

<p>Congratulations, you have reached the end of your first CS 61A project! If you
haven't already, relax and enjoy a few games of Hog with a friend.</p>
