# recursion

## new word
- circular: shaped like a circle; round
- Anatomy :the structure of an animal or a plant 
- Mutual :used to describe feelings that two or more people have for each other equally, or actions that affect two or more people equally
- Partitions：the division of one country into two or more countries 
- factorial 
- unwind 
- pebbles :a smooth, round stone that is found in or near water 
## question
- odd:奇怪的-》奇数-》 奇数 that cannot be divided exactly by the number two
- substantially ：very much; a lot
- Partitions 这个题目的意思还是不理解。
- 
- amatically in
- ecomposition:
- curry

## idea
1. 理解的每一个函数都有自己的作用于。然后函数有父级函数。调用
2. 每一个fream 就是一个box 之后。recursion is to be easy to understand.
3. leverage 
4. nuisance 
5. 中文翻译求助。

## question
1. discussion does not have solutions.. 

## concept
1. A function is called recursive if the body of the function calls the function itself, either directly or indirectly.
2. This example also illustrates how functions with simple bodies can evolve complex computational processes by using recursion.
3. we should not care about how fact(n-1) is implemented in the body of fact; we should simply trust that it computes the factorial of n-1. Treating a recursive call as a functional abstraction has been called a recursive leap of faith.
4. However, learning to recognize the computational processes evolved by recursive functions certainly requires practice.
5. what happens when a single function call makes multiple direct recursive calls.
6. multiple recursive calls may appear in the body of a function.
8. A function with multiple recursive calls is said to be tree recursive because each call branches into multiple smaller calls, each of which branches into yet smaller calls, just as the branches of a tree become smaller but more numerous as they extend from the trunk.
9. Ahigher order function(HOF) is a function that manipulates other func-tions by taking in functions as arguments, returning a function, or both
10. A lambda expression evaluates to a function, called a lambda function.  Forexample,lambda y:  x + yis a lambda expression, and can be read as afunction that takes in one parameteryand returnsx + y
11. takes mul-tiple arguments into a chain of functions that each take a single argument.This is known ascurrying.
12. The parent of any function (including lambdas) is always the frame in whichthe  function  is  defined.   

## todo
1. 有好几个lab可以做了。
2. week2 2 lab 1 hw 1 project
3. 能用字符界面操作 就尽量使用字符界面操作。。慢慢的转变过来。。
4. 就是能不用鼠标的 就不要使用鼠标。
