# mutable_sequence
## concepts
- Functions do one thing; objects do many related things
- Control characters were designed for transmission 空格 回车 换行。底层对应的ascii码也是一个二进制数字
- Only objects of mutable types can change: lists & dictionaries
- In Python, like many other programming languages, we use dot notation to designate an attribute of an object.
- Sharing and Identity. Because we have been changing a single list rather than creating new lists, the object bound to the name chinese has also changed, because it is the same list object that was bound to suits!
- Although the list is copied, the values contained within the list are not. Instead, a new list is constructed that contains a subset of the same values as the sliced list. Therefore, mutating a list within a sliced list will affect the original list.
- The append method of a list takes one value as an argument and adds it to the end of the list. 
- The extend method of a list takes an iterable value as an argument and adds each of its elements to the end of the list.
- The pop method removes and returns the last element of the list. When given an integer argument i, it removes and returns the element at index i of the list. 
- The remove method takes one argument that must be equal to a value in the list. It removes the first item in the list that is equal to its argument. Calling remove on a value that is not equal to any item in the list causes a ValueError.
- The index method takes one argument that must be equal to a value in the list. It returns the index in the list of the first item that is equal to the argument. 
- The insert method takes two arguments: an index and a value to be inserted. The value is added to the list at the given index.
- The count method of a list takes in an item as an argument and returns how many times an equal item apears in the list. If the argument is not equal to any element of the list, then count returns 0.

- While it is not possible to change which elements are in a tuple, it is possible to change the value of a mutable element contained within a tuple.
- The key to correctly analyzing code with non-local assignment is to remember that only function calls can introduce new frames. Assignment statements always change bindings in existing frames. In this case, unless make_withdraw is called twice, there can be only one binding for balance.
